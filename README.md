Date Classification with CNN (9 Classes)
This project focuses on classifying date fruits into 9 different types using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The goal is to automate the visual identification of date varieties based on their images.

ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights:
Built using TensorFlow / Keras

Trained on a labeled image dataset of 9 types of dates

Applied techniques such as:

Image preprocessing & normalization

Data augmentation (rotation, flip, zoom)

CNN architecture for feature extraction

Achieved good accuracy in distinguishing between date classes

ðŸ“‚ Dataset:
The dataset includes images of 9 different varieties of date fruits. Each image is labeled according to its type. (You can link the dataset source here if itâ€™s public.)

ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance:
The trained model achieves high classification accuracy on the validation set, demonstrating its ability to generalize to unseen images.

ðŸš€ Try It:
You can run the model in this Google Colab notebook:
