# ðŸ§  Date Fruit Classification with CNN (11 Classes)

This project focuses on classifying **date fruits** into **11 different types** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model. The goal is to automate the visual identification of date varieties based on image data.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- âœ… Built using **TensorFlow / Keras**
- âœ… Trained on a labeled image dataset containing 11 varieties of dates
- âœ… Applied standard image preprocessing techniques:
  - Resizing and normalization
  - Data augmentation (rotation, flip, zoom, etc.)
- âœ… Designed a custom **CNN architecture** for feature extraction and classification
- âœ… Evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset consists of images labeled by their corresponding date fruit class. Each class represents a different type of date.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

The model demonstrates strong classification ability, with high accuracy on both training and validation sets. It can effectively distinguish between 11 distinct date fruit types.
