# ðŸ§  Tunisian Date Fruit Classification with CNN (11 Classes)

This project focuses on classifying **Tunisian date fruits** into **11 different types** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model. The goal is to automate the visual identification of date varieties based on image data.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- âœ… Built using **TensorFlow / Keras**
- âœ… Trained on a labeled image dataset of **11 Tunisian date fruit types**
- âœ… Applied standard image preprocessing techniques:
  - Resizing and normalization
  - Data augmentation (rotation, flip, zoom, etc.)
- âœ… Designed a custom **CNN architecture** for feature extraction and classification
- âœ… Evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset consists of images of **11 Tunisian date fruit varieties**, each labeled according to its type.
